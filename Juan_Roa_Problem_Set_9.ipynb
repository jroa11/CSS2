We may also say that we can use the model to have a better understanding and estimate of the relationship between the duration of a geyser's eruption and the wait time for the next eruption. In otherwords, we can use the duration of the geyser's eruption to estimate how long we would have to wait for the next eruption."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vqb4gua9yu4C"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
